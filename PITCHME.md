# About Me

My name is Filipe Costa and I'm currently a Senior Manager of Outsystems Plaform at Capgemini. I've always been passionate about all things related with Computer Science. I belive in disrruption, and feel that we need to reinvent ourselfs in order to keep up with the ever changing world.
